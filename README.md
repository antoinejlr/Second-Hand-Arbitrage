# Second-Hand-Arbitrage

## Project goal
This personal project's end goal is to help me make a consistent profit by buying and selling canon second-hand lenses.

## Introduction
As an avid photographer/videographer, in my spare time I am often on the lookout to upgrade and sell some of my gear on second-hand websites.

The second hand online market for lenses is very vibrant as it offers buyers to save a lot of money vs the retail price (think 30 to 50% if not more).
Lenses retain a high value over time (unlike camera bodies) and many photographers offload their gear for a variety of reasons, guarenteeing a steady supply.

I have personally found myself buying a lens for a given price, using it for a couple of months and selling it for a profit.

Seeing a potential business opportunity and my passion for the field explains my motivation for taking on this project.
